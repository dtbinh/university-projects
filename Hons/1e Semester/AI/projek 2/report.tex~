\section{Question 1}
This question was not answered.

\section{Question 2}
\subsection{Part a}
The decision tree application was developed in Java 1.5.0. To execute the application type \emph{java dtree} to see all parameters that can be passed to the program. The application accepts a training file to build a decision tree based on the values found in the training file. Relative information gain was used as the criteria for splitting the tree for every branch. The entropy of a set is defined as a value which represents the distribution of the data. A high entropy means the data is disordered and represented by peaks and valleys. A low entropy means the data is almost a normal distribution. Relative information gain enables us to find the split which will allow the entropy to decrease.

In my application real numbers are split according to the mean value of all the numbers. Other types of categories are split according to the possible values they can obtain. The application starts off with a root node and all the data available. From here all the branching is done by the splitting criteria until a decision can be reached. It is possible to have a holdout set which is used to prune the tree for any errors. This process, reduced error pruning, was added to my application, but because of time constraints was not completed.

When the decision tree has been built the tree can be saved to an output file. The syntax that the tree is saved in is a pre-order traversal method. Which means that it always branches to the left first.
\subsection{Part b}
This question was not implemented.

\section{Question 3}
For this question I developed an application which reads a decision tree, that is saved to a file in my chosen syntax, and saves a graphical representation of the tree to a image file. To execute this application type in \emph{java writeImage tree image}, where \emph{tree} is the name of file containing the decision tree and \emph{image} is the name of the jpeg file the image should be saved to.
\section{Question 4}
\subsection{Part a}
I obtained the adult data set.
\subsection{Part b}
The first 28000 points of the adult data set was kept and the rest discarded because I did not implement error pruning.
\subsection{Part c}
The tree in Fig.~\ref{Fig:4c} was generated
