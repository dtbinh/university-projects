</br></br>
Welcome to my honours project website. This site is dedicated to my honours project for 2006. This is in compliance for the degree B.Sc Hons (Computer Science).
</br></br>
My project is the development of an application to facilitate motion tracking of hand movements for use in developing a sign language dictionary for the South African Sign Language.
</br></br>
If you follow the links on the left you will find information about me and the project. I hope you enjoy the site.
