<P>"ELIZABETH'S ADVICE ON THE PAINTING OF PORTRAITS"<BR>Excerpted from the 
memoirs of portrait painter <A name=Elizabeth></A>Elizabeth Vigee-LeBrun 
(1755-1842)<BR>"I have decided to add here at the end of my memoirs the advice 
that I wrote my niece, Mme J. Tripier Le Franc, thinking that it might also be 
of interest to others.<BR>
<CENTER>POINTS THAT SHOULD BE OBSERVED BEFORE YOU BEGIN TO PAINT</CENTER><BR>You 
should always be ready half an hour before the model arrives. This helps to 
gather your thoughts and is essential for several reasons: <BR>1 You should 
never keep anyone waiting.<BR>2 The palette must be prepared.<BR>3 People or 
business should not interfere with your concentration.
<P>AN ESSENTIAL RULE<BR>You must sit your model down, but at a higher level than 
yourself. Make sure that the women are comfortable, that they have something to 
lean against, and a stool beneath their feet.
<P>You should be as far away from your model as possible; this is the only way 
to catch the true proportion of the features and their correct alignment, as 
well as the sitter's bearing and particular mannerisms which it is essential to 
note; the same applies when trying to achieve an overall likeness. Do we not 
recognize people we know from behind, even when we cannot see their face?
<P>When painting a man's portrait, especially that of a young man, he should 
stand up for a moment before you begin so that you can sketch the general 
outline of the body. If you were to sketch him sitting down, the body would not 
appear as elegant and the head would appear too close to the shoulders. This is 
particularly necessary for men since we are more used to seeing them standing 
than seated.
<P>Do not paint the head too high on the canvas since it makes the model look 
too tall, though if you draw the head too low, the model will become too small; 
when drawing the body, take care to allow more space on the side to which the 
body is turned.
<P>You should also have a mirror positioned behind you so that you can see both 
the model and your painting at the same time, and it should be in a place where 
you can refer to it all the time; it is the best guide and will show up faults 
clearly.
<P>Before you begin, talk to your model. Try several different poses. Choose not 
only the most comfortable but also the most fitting for the person's age and 
character, so that the pose will only add to the likeness. Likewise for the 
head, which should either be facing forward or at a three-quarter turn; this 
adds to the resemblance, especially for the public; the mirror might also help 
you decide upon this point.
<P>You should try and complete the head, or at least the basic stages, in three 
or four sittings; allow an hour and a half for each sitting, two hours at the 
most, or the models will grow bored and impatient and their expression will 
change noticeably, a situation to be avoided at all costs; this is why you 
should allow models to rest and aim to keep their attention for as long as 
possible. My experience with women has led me to believe the following: you must 
flatter them, say they are beautiful, that they have fresh complexions etc. This 
puts them in a good humor and they will hold their position more willingly. The 
reverse will result in a visible difference. You must also tell them that they 
are marvelous at posing; they will then try harder to hold their pose. Tell them 
not to bring their friends to the sitting, for they all want to give advice and 
will spoil everything, although you may consult artists and people of taste. Do 
not be discouraged if some people cannot find any likeness in your portraits; 
there are a great many people who do not know how to look at a painting.
<P>While you are working on the head of a woman dressed in white, drape her in a 
neutral colored fabric like grey or light green, so that your gaze does not 
wander from the model's head; if however you wish to paint her in white, keep a 
little white fabric to drape around the head, for it too should receive some of 
the reflected light.
<P>The background to the sitter should in general be a subtle and uniform tone, 
neither too light nor too dark; if the background is sky than the rules are 
different and you should put something blue behind the head.
<P>Whether you are painting in pastels or oils, you should build up from the 
darkest colour, then paint the mid-tones and finally the highlights.
<P>Always thicken the highlights and always make them golden. Between the 
highlights and the mid-tones there is another tone not be overlooked, which has 
tints of violet, blue and green. Study van Dyck. The mid-tones should be broken 
up and less thick than the highlights, and the highlighting on the head should 
emphasis the bone and muscle, the latter being weaker than the former.
<P>Immediately after the first layer comes the flesh tone, chosen according to 
the complexion of the sitter; this will eventually blend with the mingling, 
shifting mid-tones.
<P>Shadow must be strong but transparent at the same time, that is to say not a 
thick but a ripe tone, accompanied by a strong reddish touch in the cavities, 
such as the eye socket, the nostrils and the darker, interior parts of the ear 
etc. The colour of the cheeks, if they are unpowdered, should have a peach tone 
in the hollows and a golden rose colour on the more fleshy parts, the two 
colours merging imperceptibly with the highlights to emphasis the facial bones 
which should be golden. There should always be highlights on the brow bone, the 
cheek bone near the nose, above the upper lip, in the corner of the lower lip 
and at the top of the chin and they should always blend in with the surrounding 
tones. 
<P>You should take care that the highlights diminish gradually and that the most 
salient and consequently the brightest part is always the most luminous. On the 
head, the sparkling lights, both sharp and diffuse, are either in the pupil or 
in the white of the eye, depending upon the position of the head and the eye; 
these two highlights often give way to others less golden in the middle of the 
upper eyelid, in the middle of the lower eyelid, or at least along some part of 
it, according to the way light falls upon the head, than on the middle of the 
nose, on the bridge and the lower lip. The sharper the nose, the finer the light 
should be. 
<P>Never use a heavy consistency of paint on the pupils: they will look more 
real if they have a transparent quality. You should paint in as much detail as 
possible, take care not to give the sitter an ambiguous gaze, and ensure that 
you make the pupils round. Some people have large pupils and others small, but 
they are always perfectly round. The upper half of the pupil is always 
intercepted by the upper eyelid, but if the person is angry you will often see 
the whole pupil. When the eye smiles, the lower half of the pupil is intercepted 
and covered by the lower eyelid. The white of the eye in shadow should be a pure 
and pristine tone, and the mid-tones, although they are not quite the natural 
colour (this is so with any object you paint), should never look grey or dirty. 
Sometimes the eye should reflect light from the nose and share some of its 
shadow. The eyelashes in the shaded part are clear and stand out bright and this 
is why you should use ultramarine when painting a light part that is in shadow. 
<P>Observe the eye socket, which should be darker or lighter depending on its 
shape. It is made up of shadow and highlights, mid-tones and reflections from 
the nose. The eyebrow should be prepared in warm tones and one should be able to 
see the flesh beneath the gleam of the hairs which should be light and delicate.
<P>The setting of the eye is always painted in delicate bluish or violet tones, 
depending upon the whiteness and delicacy of the skin. Take care not to be too 
heavy with the latter or the eye will look as though it's full of tears. For 
this reason one should sometimes break into the blue tones with gold, but always 
cautiously.
<P>Observe the forehead well; it is vital for a true likeness and is a very 
important key to the personality. When the forehead has a square but prominent 
bone, such as in the self portraits of Raphael, Rubens or van Dyck, there is a 
definite concentration of light on these prominent areas. The first is at the 
top of the forehead, just beneath the hairline. It is then interrupted and 
reappears near the eyebrow. This in turn gives way to the colour of the temple 
where there will often be a blue vein visible, especially if the sitter's skin 
is very fine. In between these highlights is the natural flesh tone which fades 
into the center. 
<P>The light returns, if more feebly, on the same bone on the other side. This 
mid-tone mingles softly with all the other mid-tones, eventually becoming the 
shadow that defines the shape of the brow bone. After this shadow, there is a 
slightly golden reflection, depending upon the colour of the hair. Above the 
eyebrow, the tone should become a little warmer: the accumulation of these hairs 
has the same effect as a mass of curls falling onto a well lit forehead. The 
shadow is warm. Look at the heads of Greuze and study the way in which your 
model's hair grows, this will add to the likeness and the painting will be more 
truthful. You should observe the part where the hair falls next to the skin so 
that you will be able to render it as realistically as possible; there should 
never be a hard line between the two; the hair and the skin should mingle 
slightly, in form and colour; this way the hair will not look like a wig, an 
inevitable error if one does not follow the method I have just described.
<P>The hair should be drawn in a body and should remain as such for the most 
part; it is probably better to use a glaze, otherwise the colours may bleed into 
the shadow and the main flesh tones of the face. The highlights on the hair are 
only visible on the prominent parts of the head; curls reflect light in the 
center and a few stray hairs break the uniformity. The edge of the hair should, 
like metal, have something of the background colour, for this helps to 
accentuate the turn of the head.
<P>It is also essential to study the ear and to place it in the correct 
position, understanding that it is a link between the head and the neck; you 
should make the shape as beautiful as you can; study the art of antiquity or 
beautiful examples in nature. For example, you might notice how in general the 
German, and especially the Austrian race, have ears that are situated a little 
too high according to perfect proportion. Likewise, the way the neck sits upon 
the shoulders is different from that of other peoples: it is wide, thick and 
rises high behind the ear. 
<P>These people also have very strong temple bones. So if you happen to be 
painting a German, you should conserve this characteristic trait, along with the 
prominent forehead and the usually flat, sunken cheeks. As far as possible, try 
and paint the complete ear and study its cartilage formation well, even if you 
are going to paint hair over it. The colour that determines its shape should be 
warm and transparent, apart from the ear hole which should always be dark and 
opaque. 
<P>Its flesh tones, even when highlighted, should in general be less luminous 
than the cheek, which is more prominent. The shadow thrown on the neck by the 
ear is very warm in daylight; the jaw should be drawn in subtle tints with 
delicate mid-tones in order to obtain the depth between jaw and neck. If the 
head belongs to a woman, the base of the jaw should have warmer tones than that 
of a man, whose beard absorbs the naturally warm flesh tones beneath. The shadow 
on the neck should also be very subtle and less ruddy than the face. It is 
essential to observe the proportion of the collarbones relative to the position 
of the head, as well as the way they reflect light; the chest area becomes a 
little deeper in colour towards the point where the collar bones meet; in 
general the articulations, such as the elbow, the kneecap, the heel and the 
knuckles are always darker than the rest of the body.
<P>If you have to paint breasts, put the model in a position where they are well 
lit; the best conditions for painting breasts occur when the light is direct and 
the colour should grow gradually stronger towards the nipple; the mid-tones 
which curve around the breast should be as light and fresh as possible; the 
shadow between the breasts should be warm and transparent.
<P>There are rules for the gradation of light, such as I have described for the 
head, for the rest of the body. If the figure is seated, the light focuses 
strongly upon the thighs and will gradually fade towards the heel." Elizabeth 
Vigee-LeBrun (1755-1842)<BR>
