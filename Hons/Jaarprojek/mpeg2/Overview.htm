<H1>TM5 Overview</H1>

<p>
The Test Model served as a cook book for creating bitstreams during 
the collobrative co-exerpimental phase of MPEG-2 video.  The many
documented experiments were an attempt to verify the usefulness of
various proposed coding techniques.  Each participant would follow
the recipe given in the TM document to create an encoder. If the
proposal met the criteria (coding gain, implementation complexity,
robustness)--it survived.  In the end, only a handful made their way into
the MPEG syntax.

<p>
The last major update of the Test Model document, version 5, took place 
at the Sydney, Australia meeting of the MPEG working group (WG11) in 
March 1993. Since the MPEG-2 main profile syntax froze at this meeting,
only limited scalability experiments continued past March 1993. A small
two page delta document describing Temporal Scalability experiments,
affectionately called "TM 6", was produced at the New York City meeting in 
July 1993.  From then on, direct bitstream exchanges among participants of the
working group helped to resolve ambiguities in the official MPEG working 
draft document which ultimately became the official standard document
(ISO/IEC 13818-2, ITU-T H.262) we all know and love today.

<H2>History:</H2>

<p>
The Test Model evolved in parallel with the MPEG video working draft.
The TM series was a joint effort between ITU-T SG15.1 (known then
as  CCITT SG XV, Working Party XV/1, Experts Group on ATM Video Coding)
and ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29 WG11 (MPEG).

<H2>Parent models:</H2>
<P>
The first drafts of the coding models inhereted much of the coding methods
and documentation style from previous standardization efforts.
</P>
<PRE>
 MPEG-1: final document was SM-3 (Simulation Model version 3)
 H.261:  final document was RM-8 (Reference Model version 8)
</PRE>

<H2>TM 5 Main Profile relevant sections</H2>
<P>
Sections 1-8, 10, Appendix B, C, K and L of Test Model 5.0 apply to the 
Main Profile syntax of today.  Of course, corresponding sections
in the official MPEG document (IS 13818-2  /  ITU-T H.262) always
supersede those in the Test Model.  Section 9, Appendix D through L
are mostly scalability sections, many of which no longer even 
apply to the scalability syntax of today.

<P>
The following is a list of comments on those sections which DO
apply to Main Profile:
<P>

<H3>1 Introduction</H3>
  The document is no longer maintained.  Please do not contact 
  the editor (Koster) unless for historical purposes :-)

<H3>2.3.2 Hierarchical profile</H3>
 - features in "Hierarchical profile" merged into High Profile.

 - "Harmonized scalable solution" was never found.  SNR and 
   Spatial Scalable streams remain separate today.

<H3>2.3.3 Professional profile</H3>
 - features in "professional profile" merged into High Profile.

<H3>3.3.1 conversion of CCIR 601 to the 4:2:0 format</H3>
<P>
 Although chroma subsampling is a display process which falls outside 
 the official scope (normative) of the MPEG standard, it should be done 
 properly for quality reasons.  The Encoder's chroma decimator should 
 anticipate the behaviour of the Decoder's chroma interpolator.  The MPEG 
 bitstream header element chroma_420_type was meant to convey which of two 
 methods (interlaced or progressive) a decoder should use to upsample 
 (interpolate) the decoded chroma output. By November 1994, chroma_420_type 
 became synonymous (and therefore redundant) with the progressive_frame 
 header element. chroma_420_type was kept in the syntax for compatibility 
 reasons. After all, the syntax was frozen over 1 year earlier!
<P>

 Test Model 5 gives two sinc conversion filters suitable for intra-field 
 vertical chroma subsampling in interlaced video:
<P>
<PRE>
    {-29,0,88,138,88,0,-29}/256  for field 1
    {1,7,7,1}/16                 for field 2
 
      4:2:2   4:2:0

        Odd

  An inter-field (intra-frame) filter would be used for progressive 
  video sequences which renders the subsampled chroma components centered
  between the spatial positions of the original components.

      4:2:2   4:2:0

</PRE>
<P>
  The progressive vs. interlaced vertical chroma filter was later resolved 
  at the November 1993 meeting in Seoul, Korea. Look at section 6.1.1.8 of 
  the final MPEG-2 video document (IS 13818-2 / ITU-T H.262) for a description 
  of interlaced and progressive chroma sample siting.
<P>

<H3>4. Layered Structure of video data</H3>
<P>
The official MPEG video document (IS 13818-2 section 6) does an
excellent job of describing the layred structure of video data.

<H3>5. Motion Estimation and Compensation</H3>
<P>See the modified  <A HREF="Ch5/Ch5.html">Chapter 5</A>.

<H3>6. Modes and Selection</H3>
<P>See the modified  <A HREF="Ch6/Ch6.html">Chapter 6</A>.
<H3>7. Transformation and Quantization</H3>
<P>See the modified  <A HREF="Ch7/Ch7.html">Chapter 7</A>.
<H3>8. Coding</H3>
<P>See the modified  <A HREF="Ch8/Ch8.html">Chapter 8</A>.

<P>
<P>
- An additional informative example of encoding is described in 
  Appendix D of the MPEG-1 video document (IS 11172-2).

<HR>
<P>
The following comments point out irrelevant sections with respect
to today's Scalable MPEG-2 syntax:

<P>
<H3>9. Video multiplex coder</H3>
<P> Section 9 never discusses general or Main Profile syntax.
<P>
 - frequency scalability was dropped from the MPEG toolkit.
<P>
 - the syntax and semantics for scalability in the MPEG-2 video document
   supersede those present in this section of TM 5.  The are quite
   different today than they were in April 1993.

<H3>10. Rate Control</H3>
<P>See the modified  <A HREF="Ch10/Ch10.html">Chapter 10</A>.

<H3>Appendix A: discrete cosine transform</H3>
<P>See the modified  <A HREF="AppendixA/AppendixA.html">Appendix A</A>.

<H3>Appendix B: variable length code tables</H3>
<P> This section is extremely redundant with Appendix B of IS 13818-2.
All the official VLC tables are listed there.

<H3>Appendix C: video buffer verifier</H3>
<P> The TM only referred to the video specification Working Draft... and rightly so!

<H3>Appendix D: frequency domain scalability extension</H3>
<P>
 - again, frequency scalability was dropped from the MPEG toolkit.

<H3>Appendix F: cell loss experiments</H3>
<P>
 - this experiment could be generic enough and mostly independent 
   of scalability to apply to Main Profile, although it does refer
   to jettisoned items such as leaky prediction.

<H3>F.4  AC-Leaky Prediction</H3>
<P>
 - leaky prediction was dropped from the MPEG toolkit.

<H3>F.5 Data partitioning vs. 1-layer cell loss experiment</H3>
<P>
 - data partitioning is still a part of the MPEG syntax (toolkit), 
  but is yet not enabled in any MPEG Profile.

<H3>Appendix G: Compatibility and Spatial Scalability</H3>
<P>
 - the weights for spatial scalablity were modified several
   times before the final November 1994 video standard draft.

<P>
 - the only items from Appendix G which would still apply to the 
   scalability syntax are those high-level parameters which specify 
   bitrate, M and N factors, picture types, etc.

<H3>Appendix H: Low Delay Coding</H3>
<P>
 - low delay coding is still very much a part of the Main Profile
   syntax, though is not commonly used.  See section D.5 in the
   MPEG-2 video document for a description.

<H3>H.1.6 Influence of leaky prediction on low delay coding</H3>
<P>
 - again, leaky prediction is not a part of the MPEG toolkit.

<H3>Appendix I: Frequency Domain Scalability Core Experiments</H3>
<P>
 - again, frequency scalability was dropped from the MPEG toolkit.

<H3>Appendix J: Harmonized Hybrid Scalability</H3>
<P>
 - again, no "Unified Field Coding" for scalability was reached.
   Maybe MPEG-4 will do this.  (supressing urge to comment)

<H3>Appendix K: Fast Forward and Fast Reverse Modes</H3>
<P>
 - intra_slice is still a legitimate trick mode technique (and about the
 only one viable today).

<H3>K.4 data partitioning approach</H3>
<P>
- again, data partition is still a part of the MPEG toolkit
   (cf section 7.10 in IS 13818-2 / ITU-T H.262), but yet not 
   enabled by any Profile and/or Level combination.  This section does 
   however demonstrate one of Data Partitioning's primary intended uses.

<H3>Appendix L: Data partitioning</H3>
<P>
 - see comments above
<P>
 - syntax for data partitioning has changed.  In particular,
   there is no data_partitioning_flag, intra_pbp in the sequence
   and picture headers, respectively.  Instead, Data partitioning mode
   would be signaled by the scalable_mode element (if a tag were
   defined for it).  The pbp element in Appendix L of the TM 5 document is 
   now called priority_breakpoint in the MPEG-2 video document.
   
<H3>Appendix Q: Quantization</H3>
<P>
 - The 8x1 DCT mode was an attempt to solve the ringing
   artifacts present around "text" and other sharp edges within
   reconstructed pictures.  It is not a part of the
   MPEG toolkit.  Careful coding using existing syntax tools 
   (macroblock <i>quantizer_scale</i>) is recommended.
